I was lost and weary

Found in hurt and shame

But there came Your love

And washed it all away

How could I respond

<b>Dm</b>
To such gracious love

All I can do is to offer

<b>Gm</b>        <b>Bb</b>          <b>C</b>
All I am before Your alter

All I am is Yours forever

<b>Bb</b>
Oh, my heart will rest in You
