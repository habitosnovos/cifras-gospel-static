 <b>C</b>
For all of my life
                       <b>Dm</b>
Oh my lord I will praise you
                  <b>G</b>
Because my breath is your life
                        <b>C</b>    <b>G</b>
Every time I’m feeling small
    <b>C</b>
I can hear your blessing voice
                       <b>Dm</b>
It’s sweeter than all honey
                  <b>G</b>
Take me out from this cave
                     <b>C</b>    <b>G</b>
And lead me up to the sky
    <b>C</b>
I have seen a lot of troubles
                  <b>Dm</b>
Strong wind went away
                <b>G</b>
I have seen many snares

But your voice relieves my fears

You command to the stars
                    <b>Dm</b>
To the sea its boundaries
                <b>G</b>
I’m feeling safe so far

In yours arms, oh my lord

That shut before a such sweet voice

The storm is ceasing rigth now

A shield for those that trust in
